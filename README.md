# ATS-Redesign
Redesigning how the Altius Tech Solutions Inc. website looks.

No back-end files are in this repo, only front-end.

Main purpose of this is to simply and stricly redesign the layout and design of the website *without* changing any back-end files such as PHP, Python, etc.

If you so happen to come across this, ignore it, don't fork it, or copy the code. Altius Tech Solutions Inc. still holds ownership of this code.
